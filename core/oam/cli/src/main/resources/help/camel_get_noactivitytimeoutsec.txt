Name
	camel get noactivitytimeout

SYNOPSIS
	camel set noactivitytimeout

DESCRIPTION
	Retruns the noactivitytimeout value.
	
	Once TCAP dialog is established, if there is no activity for 'x' 
	seconds, it will timeout. 'x' is configurable, please see 
	tcap set dialogidletimeout command. However in case of Camel 
	Applications, the dialog can live much longer (for example call).
	Camel gateway will keep renewing the TCAP dialog automatically, 
	however if peer side is faulty or application didn't send proper 
	response to end TCAP dialog, there will be leak and dialog will 
	remain alive forever. To avoid such situations set the 
	noactivitytimeout in seconds such that if there is no activity 
	in dialog for 'noactivitytimeout' sec, Camel gateway will call 
	application indicating same. Application may take corrective action 
	like End TCAP dialog or send empty response back in which case TCAP 
	dialog continues and Camel gateway again makes call to application 
	after 'noactivitytimeout'
