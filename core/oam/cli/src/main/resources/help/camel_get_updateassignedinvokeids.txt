Name
	camel get updateassignedinvokeids

SYNOPSIS
	camel get updateassignedinvokeids

DESCRIPTION
	
	Retruns the value of updateassignedinvokeids
	
	Once Application sends back HTTP response carrying CAP messages as XML 
	payload to be sent to peer, Camel gateway will send these invokes to 
	peer and assign InvokeId generated by Camel gateway. HTTP Application 
	wouldn't be aware of which invoke id belongs to which CAP message and 
	hence if there are some error's reported by peer (carrying invoke id), 
	HTTP application wouldn't know this error is for which invoke? To avoid 
	such situation set the updateAssignedInvokeIds to true so Camel gateway 
	will send back HTTP request carrying all the assigned invokeId's as soon as it sends Invoke to peer

PARAMETERS
