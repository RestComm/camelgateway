# RestComm Camel Gateway
Enables web developers to build server side interactive IN networks for mobile phones using SS7 Camel Application Part (CAP) protocol.

## Introduction 

CAMEL stands for Customized Applications for Mobile networks Enhanced Logic. It is a set of standards designed to work on either a GSM core network or on a UMTS network. CAMEL allows an operator to define services over standard GSM services/UMTS services. The CAMEL architecture is based on the Intelligent network (IN) standards, and uses the CAP protocol.

Many services can be created using CAMEL, especially, services relating to roaming subscribers:

 * Virtual Private Network (VPN)
 * Call Redirect Services (CRS)
 * Conditional Call Forwarding (CCF)
 * SMS

RestComm Camel Gateway is built on [RestComm jSS7](https://github.com/RestComm/jss7) and RestComm JSLEE Server.
