/**
 * Simplified deployement framework designed for hot deployement of endpoints and media components.
 * 
 * Deployement is represented by tree of folders. Each folder may contains one or more deployement descriptors. The most
 * top deployment directory is referenced as root. Maindeployer creates recursively HDScanner for root and each nested
 * directoty. The HDScanner corresponding to the root directory is triggered periodicaly by local timer and in it order
 * starts nested scanners recursively.
