        <title>Multi tenancy support</title>
        <para>
        	Multi tenancy allows a single instance of &THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; to connect to different operators, with each connection having its own links and point-codes.
        </para>
        <para>
			&THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; achieves Multi tenancy by splitting a model of SS7 network into several logical networks. Each logical network has a corresponding digital key called <literal>"networkId"</literal> with a default value of 0 (unless specified differently). For every <literal>"networkId"</literal>, you can specify a corresponding HTTP Application to separate the business logic for each network. 
        </para>
        <note>
