								If you are using the SS7 board on your server, you must ensure that the <literal>java.library.path</literal> variable is set to point to the directory containing 
								the native component. Alternatively you can copy it to the JBoss native library path manually.
							</para>

					<para>
						In order to start the Gateway, you must start the JBoss Application Server. Execute the <filename>run.sh</filename> (Unix) or 
						<filename>run.bat</filename> (Microsoft Windows) startup script in the <filename>restcomm-camelgw-6.1.1.GA/jboss-5.1.0.GA/bin</filename> folder (on Unix or Windows).
						Note that this will start the server in the default profile. The "default" profile is a clean profile, which entails configuring the entire SS7 Stack and CAMEL Gateway.
					</para>
				</step>
				<step><para>Result: If the service started properly you should see the following last few output lines in the Unix terminal or Command Prompt depending on your environment:

		<title>Running the Gateway - Simulator Profile</title>
			<para>
				The &THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; offers you an option to run the Gateway with a "simulator" profile for testing purpose. 
				The "simulator" profile is a pre-configured profile to work with the jss7-simulator. Starting the Gateway with the "simulator" profile is 
				similar to the steps explained for the "default" profile except that you must pass the string value "simulator" to the -c command line option when invoking the run script.

			<title>Running the Shell</title>	
		<para>
			Before you execute commands to configure the Gateway, you must start the Shell client and connect to the managed instance. The shell terminal can be started by issuing the following command from
			<filename>restcomm-camelgw-6.1.1.GA/jboss-5.1.0.GA/bin</filename> directory:

		<programlisting>[$] ./ss7-cli.sh</programlisting>

	<para>
			Executing further commands requires that you connect to a managed instance. For more details on connecting to an instance; for a list of all supported commands 
			and details on configuring the SS7 stack, refer to the Restcomm SS7 Stack User Guide.
