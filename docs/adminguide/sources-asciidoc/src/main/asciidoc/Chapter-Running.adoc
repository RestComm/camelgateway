== Running the Gateway

.Procedure: Run {this-platform} {this-application} 
. Pre-requisite: 
+
* You must have {this-platform} {this-application} installed as explained in the Installation Guide.
* If you are using the SS7 board on your server, you must ensure that the `java.library.path` variable is set to point to the directory containing  the native component.
  Alternatively you can copy it to the JBoss native library path manually. 

. In order to start the Gateway, you must start the JBoss Application Server.
  Execute the [path]_run.sh_ (Unix) or  [path]_run.bat_ (Microsoft Windows) startup script in the [path]_restcomm-camelgw-6.1.1.GA/jboss-5.1.0.GA/bin_ folder (on Unix or Windows). Note that this will start the server in the default profile.
  The "default" profile is a clean profile, which entails configuring the entire SS7 Stack and CAMEL Gateway. 
. Result: If the service started properly you should see the following last few output lines in the Unix terminal or Command Prompt depending on your environment:

. You need to use the Shell Client to connect to {this-application-dirname} {this-version}  and configure the SS7 Stack and CAMEL Gateway routing rule.

NOTE: If you are starting {this-application-dirname} {this-version} for the first time, you must configure SS7.

Once configured, the state, the configuration of SS7 and CAMEL is persisted.
This means that your configuration will still be available even after restarting the server.
The next chapter will provide more details about configuring SS7 and the CAMEL Gateway.


.Procedure: Stop the Gateway
. To stop the {this-platform} {this-application} , you must shut down the JBoss Application Server.
  To shut down the server(s) you must execute the `shutdown.sh -s` (Unix) or  `shutdown.bat -s` (Microsoft Windows) script in the [path]_restcomm-camelgw-6.1.1.GA/jboss-5.1.0.GA/bin_					directory (on Unix or Windows).
. If the server stopped properly, you will see the following three lines as the  last output in the Unix terminal or Command Prompt: 
----
[Server] Shutdown complete
Halting VM
----

[[_running_the_gateway_simulator]]
== Running the Gateway - Simulator Profile

The {this-platform} {this-application} offers you an option to run the Gateway with a "simulator" profile for testing purpose.
The "simulator" profile is a pre-configured profile to work with the jss7-simulator.
Starting the Gateway with the "simulator" profile is  similar to the steps explained for the "default" profile except that you must pass the string value "simulator" to the -c command line option when invoking the run script.
 
----

[bin]$ ./run.sh -c simulator
----


[[_running_shell]]
== Running the Shell

Before you execute commands to configure the Gateway, you must start the Shell client and connect to the managed instance.
The shell terminal can be started by issuing the following command from [path]_restcomm-camelgw-6.1.1.GA/jboss-5.1.0.GA/bin_ directory: 

[source]
----
[$] ./ss7-cli.sh
----

Once console starts, it will print the following information and await further commands:

----

version=2.0.0-SNAPSHOT,name=restcomm CLI,prefix=mobicents,vendor=TeleStax
restcomm>
----

Executing further commands requires that you connect to a managed instance.
For more details on connecting to an instance; for a list of all supported commands  and details on configuring the SS7 stack, refer to the Restcomm SS7 Stack User Guide.
