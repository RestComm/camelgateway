= Introduction

&THIS.PLATFORM;&THIS.APPLICATION;is an Open Source Java based SMSC Gateway built on a modern extensible middleware platform and provides easy integration with any third party communication protocol and platform. &THIS.PLATFORM;&THIS.APPLICATION;enables mobile operators to provide core SMSC features like subscriber to subscriber SMS messaging, broadcasting campaigns and group messagingfootnote:[Group Messaging can be achieved using  RestComm. For more details please contact info@telestax.com.] between subscribers.
In addition it also enables value added services through integration with OTT social networks and microblogs such as Facebook and Twitter.
 

&THIS.PLATFORM;&THIS.APPLICATION;is an easy-to-install and easy-to-deploy platform that can be set up and configured very quickly.
Since it is built on a modern and extensible JSLEE platform it automatically provides out-of-the-box integration with various communication protocols such as SIP, Diameter, HTTP, XCAP, XMPP, MGCP and others in addition to the base SMPP protocol for connectivity to ESMEs.
 

&THIS.PLATFORM;&THIS.APPLICATION;stores messages using Cassandra database.
The database is used for storing unsent messages, messages successfully sent and messages that failed to be sent. 

&THIS.PLATFORM;&THIS.APPLICATION;is cloud-ready.
It can be deployed on dedicated hardware, private cloud infrastructure or public laaS such as AWS. &THIS.PLATFORM;&THIS.APPLICATION;supports TDM hardware offered by major vendors in the market, namely Intel family boards (Dialogic) and  Zaptel/Dahdi (Digium, Sangoma). 

&THIS.PLATFORM;&THIS.APPLICATION;is based on the robust and proven &THIS.PLATFORM;JAIN SLEE 1.1 Server and &THIS.PLATFORM;jSS7 Stack. &THIS.PLATFORM;JAIN SLEE Server is a highly scalable event-driven application server with a robust component model and fault tolerant execution environment.
It provides a set of connectors to a variety of networks elements: SS7 MAP, TCAP, INAP, ISUP, SMPP, XMPP, SIP, MGCP, HTTP, XDM, XCAP, Diameter and many others.
It is fully compliant with JSR 240 (JSLEE 1.1). &THIS.PLATFORM;jSS7 is a software based implementation of the SS7 protocol.
It provides implementation for Level 2 and above in the SS7 protocol Stack. &THIS.PLATFORM;jSS7 Stack User Guide is bundled within and you can refer to the guide for more details on the Stack. 

The Open Source Software gives you the flexibility to understand the readily available source code and the freedom to customise the product to meet your Enterprise needs.

This guide provides details on configuring and using the platform and information regarding the supported protocols and compliant standards.
For installation instructions, please refer to the Installation Guide published along with this.
