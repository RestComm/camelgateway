----

Name
	smppserver set port

SYNOPSIS
	smppserver set port <port>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to set the port that the SMSC server is listening to for 
	incoming bind request. 

	If unspecified, the default port is 2776.

	You must restart the SMPP Server for the new value to take effect.

----

Name
	smppserver set bindtimeout

SYNOPSIS
	smppserver set bindtimeout <bind-timeout>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to set a value for bind-timeout in milli-seconds. 
	Once the TCP socket is established, the SMSC server will wait for the time period 
	specified by the parameter bind-timeout in milli-seconds, for the peer to send a 
	bind request, after which it will kill the TCP socket.

	If unspecified, the default value is 5000 milli-seconds.

	You must restart the SMPP Server for the new value to take effect.
----

----

Name
	smppserver set systemid

SYNOPSIS
	smppserver set systemid <system-id>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to set the value for system-id. This is the 'system-id' 
	included in the Bind response.

	You must restart the SMPP Server for the new value to take effect.
----

----

Name
	smppserver set autonegotiateversion

SYNOPSIS
	smppserver set autonegotiateversion <true/false>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to specify if auto-negotiate-version is enabled or not.
	If it is set to 'true' and a Bind is received with version <= 3.3 for 
	interface version, then it is normalized to version 3.3. If a Bind is received 
	with version >= 3.4 for interface version, it is normalized to version 3.4.

	The default value is true.

	You must restart the SMPP Server for the new value to take effect.
----

Name
	smppserver set interfaceversion

SYNOPSIS
	smppserver set interfaceversion <interface-version>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to specify the SMPP version that the Server supports. 

	You must restart the SMPP Server for the new value to take effect.
----

----

Name
	smppserver set maxconnectionsize

SYNOPSIS
	smppserver set maxconnectionsize <max-connection-size>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to specify the maximum number of connections/sessions this 
	Server is expected to handle.

	You must restart the SMPP Server for the new value to take effect.
----

----

Name
	smppserver set defaultwindowsize

SYNOPSIS
	smppserver set defaultwindowsize <defaultwindowsize>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to specify the default window size for this Server. 
	The window size is the amount of unacknowledged requests that are permitted to be 
	outstanding/unacknowledged at any given time. If more requests are added, the 
	underlying stack will throw an exception.

	The default value is 100.

	You must restart the SMPP Server for the new value to take effect.
----

----

Name
	smppserver set defaultwindowwaittimeout

SYNOPSIS
	smppserver set defaultwindowwaittimeout <default-window-wait-timeout>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to specify the default-window-wait-timeout for this Server
	in milli-seconds. 
	The window wait timeout is the time within which the connection to remote SMSC
	Server should be established.

	The default value is 30000 milli seconds.

	You must restart the SMPP Server for the new value to take effect.
----

----

Name
	smppserver set defaultrequestexpirytimeout

SYNOPSIS
	smppserver set defaultrequestexpirytimeout <default-request-expiry-timeout>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to specify the default-request-expiry-timeout for the Server 
	in milli-seconds. The request expiry timeout is the time to wait for an end-point 
	to respond to before it expires.

	The default value is 30000 milli seconds.

	You must restart the SMPP Server for the new value to take effect.
----

----

Name
	smppserver set defaultwindowmonitorinterval

SYNOPSIS
	smppserver set defaultwindowmonitorinterval <default-window-monitor-interval>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to specify the default-window-monitor-interval for the Server 
	in milli-seconds. This is the time between executions of monitoring the window for
	requests that expire. It is recommended that this value, generally, either matches 
	or is half the value of 'request-expiry-timeout'. Therefore, in the worst case
	scenario, a request could take upto 1.5 times the 'requestExpiryTimeout' to 
	clear out.

	The default value is 15000 milli seconds.

	You must restart the SMPP Server for the new value to take effect.
----

----

Name
	smppserver set defaultsessioncountersenabled

SYNOPSIS
	smppserver set defaultsessioncountersenabled <true/false>
