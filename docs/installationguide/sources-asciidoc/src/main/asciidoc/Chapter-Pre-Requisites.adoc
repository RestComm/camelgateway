| TDM Hardware | For legacy SS7 links, you must have dahdi or dialogic cards installed along with their native libraries. | 
| Operating System | The platform can be installed on any OS that supports Java and SCTP. But native libraries for SS7 cards are compiled only for Linux at the moment and therefore supported only on Linux Operating System. | The libraries will be compiled for Windows in future releases.
