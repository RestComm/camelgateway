	<title>Setting the JBOSS_HOME Environment Variable</title>
	<para>
		The <application>&THIS.PLATFORM; Platform</application> (<application>&THIS.PLATFORM;</application>) is built on top of the <application>&JEE.PLATFORM;</application>. You do not need to set the <envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar> environment variable to run any of the <application>&THIS.PLATFORM; Platform</application> servers <emphasis>unless</emphasis> <envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar> is <emphasis>already</emphasis> set.

	<para>The best way to know for sure whether <envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar> was set previously or not is to perform a simple check which may save you time and frustration.</para>

	<para>The <application>&THIS.PLATFORM; Platform</application> and most &THIS.PLATFORM; servers are built on top of the <application>&JEE.PLATFORM;</application> (<application>&JEE.PLATFORM;</application>). When the <application>&THIS.PLATFORM; Platform</application> or &THIS.PLATFORM; servers are built <emphasis>from source</emphasis>, then <envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar> <emphasis>must</emphasis> be set, because the &THIS.PLATFORM; files are installed into (or <quote>over top of</quote> if you prefer) a clean <application>&JEE.PLATFORM;</application> installation, and the build process assumes that the location pointed to by the <envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar> environment variable at the time of building is the <application>&JEE.PLATFORM;</application> installation into which you want it to install the &THIS.PLATFORM; files.
	</para>
	<para>This guide does not detail building the <application>&THIS.PLATFORM; Platform</application> or any &THIS.PLATFORM; servers from source. It is nevertheless useful to understand the role played by <application>JBoss AS</application> and <envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar> in the &THIS.PLATFORM; ecosystem.</para>
	<para>
		The immediately-following section considers whether you need to set <envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar> at all and, if so, when. The subsequent sections detail how to set <envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar> on Unix and Windows

		<para>
			Even if you fall into the category below of <emphasis>not needing</emphasis> to set <envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar>, you may want to for various reasons anyway. Also, even if you are instructed that you do <emphasis>not need</emphasis> to set <envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar>, it is good practice nonetheless to check and make sure that <envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar> actually <emphasis>isn&#39;t</emphasis> set or defined on your system for some reason. This can save you both time and frustration.

		<title>Setting the JBOSS_HOME Environment Variable on Unix</title>
		<para>
			The <envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar> environment variable must point to the directory which contains all of the files for the <phrase><application>&THIS.PLATFORM; Platform</application> or individual &THIS.PLATFORM; server</phrase> that you installed. As another hint, this topmost directory contains a <filename>bin</filename> subdirectory.

	<para>
		Setting <envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar> in your personal <filename>~/.bashrc</filename> startup script carries the advantage of retaining effect over reboots. Each time you log in, the environment variable is sure to be set for you, as a user. On Unix, it is possible to set <envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar> as a system-wide environment variable, by defining it in <filename>/etc/bashrc</filename>, but this method is neither recommended nor detailed in these instructions.
	</para>
	<procedure>
		<title>To Set JBOSS_HOME on Unix...</title>
		<step>
			<para>
				Open the <filename>~/.bashrc</filename> startup script, which is a hidden file in your home directory, in a text editor, and insert the following line on its own line while substituting for the actual install location on your system:
			</para>
			<!--  export JBOSS_HOME="/home/<replaceable>&lt;username&gt;</replaceable>/<replaceable>&lt;path&gt;</replaceable>/<replaceable>&lt;to&gt;</replaceable>/<replaceable>&lt;install_directory&gt;</replaceable>"  -->
			<screen>export JBOSS_HOME="/home/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;path&gt;/&lt;to&gt;/&lt;install_directory&gt;"</screen>
		</step>
		<step>
			<para>
				Save and close the <filename>.bashrc</filename> startup script.
			</para>
		</step>
		<step>
			<para>
				You should <command>source</command> the <filename>.bashrc</filename> script to force your change to take effect, so that <envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar> becomes set for the current session<footnote>
				<para>
					Note that any other terminals which were opened prior to your having altered <filename>.bashrc</filename> will need to <command>source</command>
						<filename>~/.bashrc</filename> as well should they require access to <envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar>.
				</para>
				</footnote>.
			</para>
			<!--  ~]$ source ~/.bashrc  -->
			<screen>~]$ source ~/.bashrc</screen>
		</step>
		<step>
			<para>
				Finally, ensure that <envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar> is set in the current session, and actually points to the correct location:
			</para>
			<note>
				<para>
					The command line usage below is based upon a binary installation of the <application>&THIS.PLATFORM; Platform</application>. In this sample output, <envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar> has been set correctly to the <replaceable>topmost_directory</replaceable> of the <application>&THIS.PLATFORM;</application> installation. Note that if you are installing one of the standalone <application>&THIS.PLATFORM;</application> servers (with <application>JBoss AS</application> bundled!), then <envar>JBOSS_HOME</envar> would point to the <replaceable>topmost_directory</replaceable> of your server installation.
